troubleshooting:
  - issue: "I can't see a channel"
    solution: "The channel may have restricted visibility. PUBLIC channels are visible to all. MODERATOR channels require Moderator+ role. GOVERNANCE channels require Governor+ role."
  - issue: "My proposal is stuck in review"
    solution: "Proposals in PENDING_REVIEW status need approval from a Moderator, Governor, or Founder. Contact your band leadership."
  - issue: "I can't dissolve my band"
    solution: "With 3+ members, dissolution requires a unanimous vote via proposal. With fewer than 3 members, only the founder can dissolve directly."
  - issue: "Payment not showing up"
    solution: "Manual payments require confirmation from the other party. Check the Manual Payments tab for pending confirmations."
  - issue: "I'm not receiving notifications"
    solution: "Check your notification settings in your profile. Also check your email spam folder for digest emails."
  - issue: "Digest email not arriving"
    solution: "Digest emails are sent daily at 8 AM UTC. Check your digest frequency settings and spam folder."
